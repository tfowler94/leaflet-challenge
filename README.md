# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with developing an earthquake visualization using html, css, javascript, as well as GeoJSON from the USGS.

When viewing the HTML file on a browser, you will be able to see the magnitude and depth of all earthquakes over the course of the prior day (6/4/23).
